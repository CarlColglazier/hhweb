Finally!

We have completed Marvin and it has been shipped off to sleep until competition
in April. This entire build season was a blast. Everyone worked hard to create
an incredible robot and had fun in the process. Though, not everything was all
fun and games. There were a lot of mishaps and miscalculations. From cutting
something a little too short to our power distribution board breaking, we had a
whole cluster of problems.

It's actually really amusing how, during the last fours days, every single
problem that could arise, came up. Along with lack of sleep, Saturday through
Monday was the most intense work we have experienced, but that didn't stop us
from laughing along the way. It has been a great build season and we enjoyed
watching the robot come together piece by piece. And now we're ready for the
NC Regional.

Look out North Carolina, the Hitchhikers are here!
