It moves! Our robot has finally begun to zip around the build room with ease.
Wheels are mounted, our program works, and we've begun to test everyone's
driving skills. We had our first driver tests today and it seems like everyone
is somewhat competent at not crashing into things.

A big announcement, we're having special guests tomorrow! Hawktimus Prime is
coming to visit and work together with The Hitchhikers. We hope to have a fun
and productive time with our guests.
