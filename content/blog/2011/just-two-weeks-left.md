Though build season ended over four weeks ago, the team has still been hard at
work perfecting our programming, strategies and minibot. Despite our efforts,
there's still a lot of work to be done. We've encountered countless problems
with our minibot, though we are working through them with great efficiency.
We've also been developing and fine-tuning our main Teleop code for the robot
after making the decision to use LabVIEW instead of C++ for the code.

In the meantime, our outreach team is hard at work on our video for the
2011 Chairman's award. The entire team is pumped for competition, and we can't
wait to see our robot in action!
