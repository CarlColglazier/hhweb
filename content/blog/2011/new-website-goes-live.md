At 1:05 am on February 12, 2011, the Hitchhikers website left beta and was
publicly released. Welcome to the new site! This layout was designed for ease
of navigation, but also to look cool. Use the navigation bar below the site
logo to easily move around the site. Check out the lates team news, read about
us, check out our photo gallery, or watch for upcoming events, all right here!

So what's new here? First of all we completely revamped the look and feel of
the site. Instead of the old blocky feel of the previous site, we have a nice,
smooth translucent look. We've added a news slider at the top of the home page,
to provide instant and easy access to the latest news updates. We've also
changed the format of the news posts, giving each post a dedicated page so it's
 easier to find in the future, as well as adding an RSS feed so you can keep
 updated from the comfort of your RSS reader. Our about section retains most of
 its original content, though it is now more organized and easier to navigate.
 We've also added a gallery of photos and videos, so you can see the team in
 action. The new calendar page provides easy access to event information,
 whether it be a team build meeting, or the days of a competiton. Last but not
 least, the Resources section contains all your basic FRC needs, from forms and
 surveys to useful links to FRC-related documents, you can find it all here.

That's about all the new stuff. We hope you like the new site, and happy
Hitchhiking!
