Well, the North Carolina Regional at Dorton Arena ended today. We placed
twenty-sixth as a team out of the fifty-two in attendance. Many other teams
fared very well, especially several of the rookie teams that participated.
[Team PyroTech][3459] placed seventh with a record of seven and three and won
the Rookie All-Star and Highest Rookie Seed Awards. [YETI Robotics][3506] went
on to win the regional with the [WiredCats][2415] and [SPARK Robotics][2751].
Congratulations to all of you!

We, on the other hand, spent the entire competition plagued by different
problems. Of our ten matches, only two went without a hitch and we hung logos in
each of those matches. In the other matches, we shorted Jaguars (twice - which
completely wreaks a mecanum drive), had the side of our arm's pivot shaft fall
out, had our minibot door fall open (makes driving a functioning mecanum drive
hard), and had our USB cables smashed in our computer (making it impossible to
plug in our joysticks and control our robot). Despite all this and the stress it
caused, we all had fun and learned to work through it.

We also had the opportunity to work with XX<sup>3</sup>XY<sup>2</sup>, another
rookie team. They had a robot, but no code for it. They had planned for several
other teams to work with them and teach them LabView, only to have them unable
to make the meetings. One of our students and one of our mentors took some of
their time to work with them and got their computers set up and their robot
moving.

Conversely, we struggled with our minibot for several weeks, and after burning
out another motor Friday, [Delphi E.L.I.T.E.][48] extended a spare minibot to
us. Even though we didn't get it up in our last two matches, it sparked us to
get our deployment system working so we can demo it in the off season, so we
extend a big "Thank You!" to them!

We plan to be active until next build season, but just in case we don't see you
until then, see you next season!
