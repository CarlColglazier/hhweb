title: The Regional at the End of the Universe
---

T-9 hours and counting! Tomorrow is the first day of the North Carolina FRC
Regional at Dorton Arena in Raleigh. Uncrating begins at 7:45am and the pits
open to everyone else at 8:30. We'll be there bright and early to make final
changes to our robot and get ready for the matches on Friday when things begin
in earnest. Saturday finishes everything up with the final matches and playoffs.
Come out and cheer the Hitchhikers on to victory!
