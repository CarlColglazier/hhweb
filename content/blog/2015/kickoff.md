A buzz of excitement ran through the room where students, alumni, and mentors
stood clustered near the TV, eagerly awaiting an impending webcast from FIRST.
After several freezes with the live feed and the long introduction that kept us
in suspense, the 2015 challenge was announced: Recycle Rush.

Recycle Rush is a game where two teams composed of three robots work to stack
totes on scoring platforms, which are a couple inches off the ground. For extra
points, teams may place recycling bins on top of these stacks, earning even more
points if a pool noodle is in or on the bin. During the autonomous period,
robots are preprogrammed to score by moving bins and recycling bins into the
auto zone. If the totes are stacked, extra points are scored. In the teleop
period, robots are controlled by human drivers as they attempt to make up to
6-tote high stacks. Unlike previous games, this game has a step in the middle
that divides the field in half, not allowing alliances to play defense against
each other.

After the challenge was announced, our team quickly broke off into smaller
subgroups and started reading the game manual and brainstorming strategies and
robot designs. A little while later, we all got together and presented our
ideas. Working cohesively, our team came up with a strategy and general robot
design.
