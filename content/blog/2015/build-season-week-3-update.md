title: "Build Season: Week 3 Update"
---

This week, the team accomplished a lot in the building and design of our robot.
One of the big focuses of the week was getting the robot to actually drive.
After 3 weeks of designing and prototyping, our robot finally came to life.
Getting to this point, though, required us to overcome a variety of issues.

One issue that we discovered early on was that the gusset plates of the
underside of the chassis were interfering with the wheels of the robot. We also
had to modify the bolts that attached the gearboxes to the chassis. Doing this
meant sanding down every bolt, which was a time consuming effort. Adding to our
difficulties, we had to modify the elevator due to height issues. In the face of
these numerous setbacks, we still managed to have a working moving chassis by
the end of the week.

During the week, we had three new students join the team. They all quickly
jumped in and have been very helpful in building and modifying the robot.
