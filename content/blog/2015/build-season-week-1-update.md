Soon after the unveiling of this year’s competition, Recycle Rush, we began
brainstorming everything from game strategies to designs for our robot. We have
met every day and have made plenty of progress in striving towards building a
robot that will be proficient in this year’s competition.

This last week, we have spent a great deal of time fine tuning our strategy and
coming up with various ways on how to achieve the tasks we want to perform. We
have built many prototypes out of wood and aluminum, trying out multiple ideas
brought up by team members. We worked on prototypes for collecting totes from
the ground along with prototypes for stacking the totes. For collecting totes,
we had the general idea of wheels pulling the totes into the robot. For stacking
the totes, we built a mechanism using pistons to lift the them up. Next, we
created a pair of claws, cut specifically to fit into the grooves under the lid
of the totes, to hold the totes. These claws were attached to motors with a
chain. We learned that this prototype failed to lift the totes any other way but
right side up.
