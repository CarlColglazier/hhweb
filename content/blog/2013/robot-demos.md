One could label a robot demo "showing off with a purpose." That is exactly what
we have been doing for the past month.

With two, high-performance robots at hand, we have traveled to local events such
as the BEST FEST in Raleigh, Robot Rumble in Durham, and the SR7B Conclave in
Carthage to spread the word about our team and others in our area.
