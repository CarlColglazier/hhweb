THOR (Thundering Herd of Robots) was North Carolina’s first off-season
tournament, where _FIRST_ Robotics teams competed with an official field in an
unofficial event. We had been looking forward to it for almost a year, so when
we finally rolled up to Reidsville High School, we were very excited.

Starting Out Slow

For this event, we had decided to give new students a chance to drive Trillian
in competition. This choice, however, did have its trade-offs; Trillian was
broken on several occasions and we lost many matches due partially to
inexperienced driving.

Picking Back Up
---------------

In order to better prepare for the looming elimination rounds, we eventually
decided to bring out our more experienced drivers. It was amazing; Trillian
scored over 60 points in one round!

With this, we had the confidence we needed to finish up qualifications.

Eliminations
------------

Our time in eliminations started out well; we won our first match with a score
of 42 to 40; however, we had some issues in the second match and we ended up
losing. This forced a third match to decide who would enter the finals.

The Final Blow
--------------

Unfortunately, things would go downhill from there; toward the beginning of the
sudden death match, we ran into a problem. Literally.

As we were driving to the feeder station, Trillian received a bump that knocked
her off her trajectory and directly into one of the tower legs.

Due to this, we were unable to shoot for the rest of the match, which eventually
led to our loss and elimination.

Conclusion

We had a blast participating in THOR (Thundering Herd of Robots), North
Carolina’s first off-season tournament. Though we may not have won, we really
enjoyed driving Trillian and reconnecting with other teams.
