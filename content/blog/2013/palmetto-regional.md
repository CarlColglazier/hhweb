This was it. After six weeks of brainstorming, designing, and building a robot
for ULTIMATE ASCENT, we were finally getting the chance to compete in the 2013
Palmetto Regional, a first week <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition Tournament.

The Palmetto Regional was big. With 65 teams, it was the largest regional of the
year.

When we arrived on the first day of the regional, we had a functional robot that
we could drive and shoot consistently. The team was out early on the field
practicing and by lunchtime, we were able to squeeze in three practice matches.
During these, we calibrated our autonomous and potentiometer, making a lot of 
progress becoming even more ready to compete by the end of the day.

Friday began the qualification rounds. In our first match, we were off to a
great start, scoring a few Frisbees into the 3-point goal and earning 10 points
by climbing up to the first bar. Despite missing during autonomous, our alliance
ended up winning the match. After competing, we returned to our pit and
continued our calibration.

Improving our robot throughout the day, we ended Saturday by scoring 128 points,
the second highest score of the qualification rounds. Eventually, we were
selected to be on one of the alliances in the elimination matches with M'Aiken
Magic ([Team 1102](http://www.usfirst.org/whats-going-on/team/FRC/15133)) and
[Team Spork](http://teamspork.com/v2/) ([Team 3196](
http://www.usfirst.org/whats-going-on/team/FRC/85713)). Although our robot
played two very strong rounds, our alliance was eliminated in the quarterfinals.


Back in Raleigh, we reviewed video footage of our matches to identify our
strengths and areas where we could improve during our next competition at the
Dorton Arena in Raleigh. Trillian is very solid, but with a few small
adjustments, we hope it will be one of the top robots at the NC Regional. 
Overall, Palmetto was a huge success.
