For this year's FIRST Robotics Competition, Ultimate Ascent, we knew that we
had to be quick if we wanted to both shoot Frisbees and climb the tower. Thus,
by week two, we had started on our shooter prototype and by the end of the
fourth week, we had completed assembling our shooter.

We were rather surprised not only by how powerful the shooter was, but also by
how successfully the hopper performed. The piston and the Frisbees worked
flawlessly together, which will hopefully help our robot shoot more
consistently. Overall, things seem to be going well.
