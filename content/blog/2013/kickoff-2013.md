FIRST Robotics Competition teams from across the state of North Carolina
gathering together in Dorton Arena can only mean one thing (well, two things
actually, but excluding the North Carolina Regional, one thing): it is time for
kickoff.

Kickoff is the start of a six week journey where FRC teams design, build, and
program a robot to compete in that year's game. This time around, we will be
shooting discs and climbing pyramids in the 2013 FRC game, Ultimate Ascent.
