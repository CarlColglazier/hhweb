The 2012 season is now in progress! The Hitchhikers spent January 7th in Raleigh
at kickoff brainstorming with other teams about this year’s challenge, Rebound
Rumble.

This year's game is called Rebound Rumble, and is based on basketball. The
robots can score in hoops positioned at three different heights for 1, 2 and 3
points respectively, and opposing teams must attempt to block the ball before it
goes in. During the last thirty seconds of the round, each team has the choice
to either continue making baskets or try to balance on a tilting bridge located
in the center of the playing field. To promote FIRST’s value of “coopertition”,
teams have the chance to earn extra points by balancing their robot on the
center bridge with an opposing team’s robot. FIRST's animation introducing the
game can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOXsdhZZSdM).

We’re looking forward to another exciting season! To all other FIRST teams out
there, good luck!
