title: The Day at the End of Build Season
---

The final day is upon us all! After six weeks of frantic planning, building, and
testing, bag and tag day is here. Before midnight tonight, every FRC team will
have to stop working and put a bag around their robot. It will have no fresh air
until their first regional competition. Then will begin a frantic three days of
fixing and competing.

Today the Hitchhikers will begin their last long workday before a well-deserved
break. Starting at nine, we will work until midnight when we zip Benjy away for
just over a month until the South Carolina regional in Charleston, March 22th to
24th.

Many things remain to be tweaked on Benjy today, and our twitter feed will be
updating with periodic reports on his status.

Remember teams! Zip by midnight, then take a hard-earned break. You've done
well; you deserve it.

Upcoming dates:

+ Bag and tag: Today!
+ South Carolina regional: 30 days
+ North Carolina regional: 44 days
+ Championships in St. Louis: 67 days
