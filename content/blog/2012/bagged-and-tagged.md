The final day of build season has come and gone. In the past it was known as
Ship, but now it's known as Bag and Tag. Instead of FedEx making rounds to
collect thousands of robots around the world, now teams will be responsible for
moving their robot to competition themselves.

Around 8:30 last night, the Hitchhikers finished up their changes on Benji,
finalizing the build and tweaking the code. We managed to fit in some time to
drive Benji around and shoot some baskets between all the work and
modifications.

But all good things must end, and Benji was bagged and tagged before we all left
for the night. The very last things were perfected and then Benji was locked
away to await our trip to South Carolina in exactly one month.

Just because build season has ended doesn't mean work stops for us. We still
have some building and programming left to do. If we can fit it in, we also have
to let our drivers get some training and work out their strategy. Oh no, the
work during build season is more intense, but it certainly isn't the only work
we do.

All in all, our build season was a huge success. We managed to bag a working
robot in Benji and not have to hold back too many pieces. Nothing catastrophic
happened to Benji or any member of the team, which is something very important
in FIRST.

Keep your eyes open over the next days and weeks for pictures and videos of
Benji. Just because we can't touch him doesn't mean we can't share him.

If you use Twitter, don't forget to follow us @team2059. We'll be keeping our
feed up to date with our activities throughout the season, up to our
competitions and beyond.

See you all in South Carolina!
