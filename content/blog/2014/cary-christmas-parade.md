Soon after coming back from THOR 2014 as finalists, we only had about a month to
modify our robots Benjy, Trillian, and Zaphod for the Cary Christmas Parade.
Benjy wasn't behaving, Zaphod's code had to be fully rewritten, and Trillian had
to be completely reassembled, since she was used at THOR by Cortech, a new FRC
team that we recently helped start. Not only did we have to rework our robots,
but we also had to build a parade float that promoted both our team and the
FIRST program from scratch.

At the parade, we had a few team members driving the robots from the back of a
pickup truck and on the float. However, every team member was able to
participate in the parade. Some interacted with the robots on the ground while
others interacted with the audience by handing out candy and flyers with
information about the FIRST program. Although the speed of the parade caught all
of us off guard, we were able to quickly adjust and continue entertaining the
crowd. The families who attended the parade were fascinated with all of our
robots and many wanted to join in on the fun.

Overall, the parade was an incredible experience for the team, and we thoroughly
enjoyed being able to spread the knowledge of the FIRST program to the parade
onlookers.

Up next: the 2015 season Kickoff!
