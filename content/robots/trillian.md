Build Season
============

Kickoff
-------

The 2013 FIRST Robotics Competition build season kicked off to an explosive
start. The design challenge was announced live at Dorton Arena, where swarms of
excited students crowded the stands for the reveal. For the next six weeks, the
students would be tasked with the creation of a robot capable of competing in
the high-speed sport of Ultimate Frisbee. Though a slightly altered version of
the game, the main objective remained the same: collect discs and shoot them
into the goals. As we would be competing with multiple targets and two pyramids,
which robots could climb at the end of every match for bonus points, the season
was bound to be a challenge.


Design
------

A large part of our build process this year was design. This included completely
modeling our robot in CAD software so we could know exactly what our finished
product would look like. Through this process, we were better prepared for any
issues that arose and we were able to get a better idea of how our final design
would work.

Assembly
--------

We managed to assemble our robot from there by using our model as a reference,
and adding to it through the year. It was a process of prototyping and creating
physical models of designs that we thought would work, and then recreating them
and implementing them in the actual body of the robot. Through our six week
build season, we went through many iterations of certain designs, and
troubleshooted and improved until we had a robot that was as effective as we
could make it. After perfecting our design, we took our robot to compete at
regionals in Palmetto.

Competition
===========

Palmetto
--------

Friday began our first qualification rounds for 2013. In our first match, we
were off to a great start, scoring a few Frisbees into the 3-point goal and
earning 10 points by climbing up to the first bar. Despite missing during
autonomous, our alliance ended up winning the match. By improving our robot
throughout the day, we ended Saturday by scoring 128 points, the second highest
score of the qualification rounds.

Eventually, we were selected to be on one of the alliances in the elimination
matches with M’Aiken Magic (Team 1102) and Team Spork (Team 3196). Although our
robot played two very strong rounds, our alliance was eliminated in the
quarterfinals to the teams that would ultimately win the tournament. Though we
didn’t win, it was still an essential experience for our team and we had a lot
of fun doing it.

North Carolina
--------------


With the knowledge we gained from an entire regional full of practice at
Palmetto, we had what it would take to succeed in North Carolina. Trillian was
performing outstandingly and would often score more than fifty points a match.

By the end of qualification matches, we were placed within the top eight.
Because of this, we were guaranteed a place in the elimination rounds. In the
end, we were in an alliance with teams Blue Eagle Robotics and The Flying
Platypi.

In the quarterfinals, we faced G.R.E.A.T., Team Spork, and the Pitt Pirates, all
of whom had performed outstandingly in the qualification rounds. After winning
the first round 61-48, we barely edged out our opponents on a tie-breaker,
advancing to the semi-finals with a score of 88-87.

Next, we found ourselves in a close contest in the semifinals against the
Hedgehogs, Gorillas, and Aluminum Assault. Losing the first match, we bounced
back and won the remaining sudden-death matches to make it into the finals. It
was exciting to hear the crowd chant the team cheer, “Don’t Panic,” as the drive
team steered the robot off the field to prepare for the finals.

Against the top-seeded alliance of the Robodogs, Mechanical Mayhem, and the
Robo Eagles, we arranged a strategy where the other alliance members would play
defense while Trillian scored as many points as possible. That strategy almost
worked; our alliance got within four points of upsetting the top alliance in the
second round. Eventually, however, we lost both matches.

Though we may not have won the regional, we still won the Regional Finalist
Award and take pride in how we performed despite their challenging match
schedule and other difficulties. We are looking forward to another great year.
Thanks to all the volunteers and fellow teams who made this all possible!
