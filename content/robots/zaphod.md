Zaphod is our 2014 robot created for Aerial Assist. This robot is able to do
every task in the game: playing defense, picking up assist points, propelling
the ball over the truss, and scoring in either the high goal or the low goal.

With a fast and maneuverable drivetrain, the robot uses two traction wheels on
each side for power and an omni on each corner for a quick response to tight
turns without compromising stability.
Its collector quickly and smoothly deploys and pulls in a ball with ease with
nearly 180 degrees of flexibility on the intake location.

Finally, Zaphod has a powerful shooter driven with four motors and a
potentiometer, which allows us to vary both the speed and shooting angle of the
ball for the perfect shot each time.
