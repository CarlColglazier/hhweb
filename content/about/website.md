Modern communication has always been important to us; when our organization was
founded in 2010, one of our first tasks was the creation of a public website.
Since then, the website has gone through many iterations, but its core
principles have remained the same.

Purpose
-------

+ **A centralized source of information.**
+ **A chronicle of our history.**
+ **A resource for our members and the larger _FIRST_ community.**

Design
------

+ **Consistent with team imagery.**
+ **Simple, stylish, and speedy.**


Technology
----------

Our website is built using several free and open source software projects. The
pages are generated by [Hugo], an [open source][hugo source] static website
engine. Since every part of our website is stored and accessed as simple HTML
web pages, each load requires only that these files be served, in contrast with
the database calls required in previous versions of the website.

Both the content and the design is maintained using git and the source code is
publicly available on [GitHub][website git]. When a new commit it pushed to the
master branch, [Travis CI], a continuous integration service, builds the website
and deploys it to our host though FTP.

When deployed, we use several [gulp] tasks to optimize the delivery of content.
HTML and CSS files are minified to speed delivery and reduce bandwidth. Gulp
is also used to compile our stylesheet from [LESS] to CSS.

Web standards:

+ HTML 5
+ CSS 3

Support
-----------

We support the current and previous version of every major browser.
